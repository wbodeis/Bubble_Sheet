## Folders
You need the three following folders:
input/
images/
results/

The most important being **input** because it is needed to begin processing the data, while the other two will be created if they don't already exist. 

### PDF Processing.
If your input files are .pdf instead of an image format (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) then you must download the folder at the link below. 
Download the most current version of poppler and save it to the root folder.
